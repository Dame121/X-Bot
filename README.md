# Daily Quote Bot

The **Daily Quote Bot** is a Python-based bot that posts daily quotes to Twitter, with customizable themes and an easy-to-use interface for managing quotes. This project leverages the **Tweepy** library for Twitter API integration, **APScheduler** for scheduling daily posts, and a **Flask** web interface for quote management.

## Features

- **Automatic Daily Tweets**: The bot automatically posts a daily quote to Twitter at a scheduled time.
- **Customizable Themes**: Select specific themes for the quotes to be posted (e.g., Motivation, Life, etc.).
- **Add New Quotes**: Easily add new quotes through the command-line interface or web interface.
- **Quote Database**: Store quotes in a simple JSON format, with the ability to track used quotes.
- **Web Interface**: A lightweight Flask web app to manage quotes and themes through a browser.
